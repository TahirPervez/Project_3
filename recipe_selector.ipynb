This would involve baking potatoes (if available), then topping them with a mixture of ground beef, canned beans, cheese, and your favorite spices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Quick Beef & Bean Pasta:** A simple and satisfying pasta dish.  Saut√© the ground beef with onions and garlic, then add canned beans and canned tomatoes. Simmer until thickened, and toss with your dried pasta.  A side salad (if you have lettuce or other greens) would complement this well, or even just some sliced pickles.\n",
